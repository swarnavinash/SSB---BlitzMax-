THE GAME
As the leader of a photography course, it is your responsibility to claim the resources that 
the students are crying out for. Each game there will be a certain amount of MONEY, LIGHTS,
and CAMERA'S to retrieve in order to keep the course going. Unfortunately, the department heads
are reluctant to co-operate and must have the resources beaten out of them... 

CONTROLS
ESC = Quit
Enter = Proceed
Left/Right = Move
Space = Punch

(Pressing left/right at the title screen adjusts the pitch of the theme song!)

Sorry for your clothes in the game... Didn't have much time to work on graphics... I gotta catch my train in half an hour. Hope You Like  IT!
